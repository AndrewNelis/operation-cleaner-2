Workers affect on preparation
and site clearing time.
Bulldozers and lorries affect
on site clearing time.
Guards affect on security and
handle possible problem
situations.
Each explosive charge takes
one blast cap for detonation.
One detonator is used in one
detonation.
The higher the explosive
charges are set the longer
fuse wires are needed.
Dampers absorb explosions
power but they are not
indestructible or cheap.

DYNAMITE
Velocity 2500-5500 m/s
Dynamite is based on nitro-
glycerin, a volatile high
explosive that is absorbed
into diatomaceous earth.
Dynamite scale varies usually
from 20 to 60. These figures
reflect the strength of the
charge. Nowadays newer
explosives have replaced
dynamite but it is pretty
inexpensive choice.
Usage: Dynamite can be used
in all purposes. Low-power
dynamite is well suited for
clearing the site with delay
fuse when the building has
already collapsed.

TNT (trinitrotoluene)
Velocity 6900 m/s
Trinitrotoluene is a very
stable high explosive and it
can be stored for years
unlike dynamite. TNT is
widely used in both military
and civil purposes. It is
quite toxic and it can cause
health problems if handled
without care. The outlook of
the explosive resembles solid
brick of soap.
Usage: Mainly in hard
structures such as steel or
concrete.




C-4
Velocity 8300 m/s
C-4 is actually a plastic 
explosive that is made of
RDX explosive, binder and
plasticizer. It is very
effective and should be
used with great care. C-4 was
developed in the 1960s. It is
very inert and can be shaped
and transported without fear
that it would detonate.
Usage: Mainly in hard
structures such as steel or
concrete.





RDX
Velocity 8700 m/s
Also known as cyclonite,
hexogen and cyclotrimethylene
trinitramine. It is widely
used by the military through-
out the world. RDX was 
initially discovered in 1890s
but it took almost 50 years
until an effective production
method was found. One of the
most powerful explosives ever
manufactured, it should be
used with extreme caution.
NOTE: Recommended mainly for
experienced detonators!
Usage: Mainly in hard
structures such as steel or
concrete.

MOVES IN!
Our humble city very proud to have a new
demolition firm. They moved in just today and
it begins working within few days. We look

this new brave company.

Angry conservationists have occupied the
building and they demand that it is saved from 
demolition. They have chained themselves to the
building.

The tenants didn't leave the building at 
agreed time.

The city wants to examine the buildings 
surrounding the target building to check their
condition before the detonation.

A minor fault was found from detonator's electric
system but it was quickly found and eliminated.

A major fault was found by manufacturer from 
explosive type you are using. The fault must be
examined before detonation may be done.

Some of the explosive charges were placed 
incorrectly because of carelessness.

Some of the equipment was stolen and new 
equipment had to be bought before job could 
go on.

Some careless hot air ballooner was nearing the
demolition zone and job had to be delayed.

Your crew is on strike for one day
because you place the explosive charges
always to the hardest places.

Tutorial
Tasks to do:
Select customer
Check crew
Place explosives part 1
Place explosives part 2
Place dampers
Detonate
Finish the site

Click on Customers button.
You can select next and
previous customers with
buttons.
You can preview the target
area with Preview button.
Select 4th customer (map nr
236553) and click Accept.

Click on Financial decisions
button.
You can increase or decrease
the amount of your crew and
view your stats.
When ready click Continue.

Now to your main task:
Place correct amount of
explosives to the target
building. You'll notice you
are on target area when
block name on top right is
on green text. Place these
explosives to positions:
X140 Y53 Dynamite 40% size 8
X153 Y53 Dynamite 40% size 8
X143 Y41 Dynamite 40% size 12
X152 Y41 Dynamite 40% size 12





You can replace charges when
you click on Add button so
it shows Select, and then
select the charge on the
scene. Another click replaces
the charge.
You can also direct explosion
to certain direction. During
placing press mouse button
and drag mouse to desired
direction. Or click on Add
button so it shows Select.
Then change direction
with direction dial.


Now place protective dampers
to the scene around the
target building. You get into
Damper mode when you click
Expl. mode button. Then click
on the map and drag area
with mouse where you wish to
place dampers. Notice that
lower part of the damper area
must be on earth.
The red circles around the
explosives mean approximation
of their destruction area.

Detonate the charges by
clicking Detonate button.

Note that you can place
explosives again and detonate
them if the first detonation
didn't go as planned.
It is important to reduce the
amount of rubble so that
clearing costs are reduced,
but placing charges on broken
blocks costs more.

End this site with clicking
button Finish this site.

This is end of tutorial.
You'll need some more practise.
That was a pretty decent detonation.
Excellent job!
Good luck to your career!
