NOTES:
- Do not use spaces in the directory names.
- Language directory must include following files:
	- blocks.txt		block names		max. row length 25 characters
	- buildings.txt		building names		max. row length 50 characters
	- cities.txt		city names and info	max. row length 50 characters
	- gametxt.txt		all other game texts	max. row length 50 characters


TIPS:
- When translating from language to another, first make copy of the original directory and work in the copy directory.
- Blocks.txt contains some words that recur (for example ground), they may be replaced easily in the notepad or word processor
