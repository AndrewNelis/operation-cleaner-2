NOTES:
- Theme must have two similarly named files that are located in the themes directory:
	- [theme_name].txt
	- [theme_name].bmp

- TXT file:
	- first row has three numbers: Red Green Blue values that determine the overall color theme
	- next five rows have information about the theme, max. length 50 characters. Even if not used, these rows must exist (plain line feeds are ok). 
	- last row has information about the author.

- BMP file:
	- must be saved as 32-bit Windows bitmap.

TIPS:
- When making a new theme, first make copy of the original files and work with the copy files.
- Test new theme with lots of screens so that the end result is good.
- It's a good idea to avoid bright green or bright red themes because the green and red texts might be lost in the background. Very bright themes may be overall a bit troublesome.
