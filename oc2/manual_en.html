<H2>GENERAL</h2>
The meaning of this game is to demolish buildings and keep your demolition firm profitable. There are lots of expenses and costs that require cash, for example explosives, crew payments, bulldozer hire, taxes, accountant costs, insurances.
<p>
Latest news and information can be found from <a href="http://koti.mbnet.fi/jnyman/cleaner2/" target="blank">The Operation Cleaner 2 website</a> (opens in new window).

</ul>

<h4><a name="ingame">IN-GAME MENUS</h4>
This section describes the right-side panel during the game. 
<ul>
<li><i>Explosives menu</i> - You can select used explosive from this menu
</ul>

<p>The next button has three modes:
<ul>
<li><b>Add</b> - Add explosives to the map. 
<li><b>Select</b> - Select explosive from map.
<li><b>Move</b> - Move selected explosive to different location.
</ul>
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Remove</b> - Remove selected explosive charge.
<li><b>Det.sel.</b> - Detonate selected explosive charge
<li><b>Unit size</b> - Size of the current explosive charge
<li><b>Delay</b> - Delay of the current explosive charge
<li><b>Direction</b> - Explosion direction of the current explosive charge (the cone is 90 degrees wide)
<li><b>Blast caps</b> - Every explosive charge uses one blast cap.
<li><b>Detonators</b> - Every explosion uses one detonator.
<li><b>Fuse wire</b> - The higher the explosive is set from ground the more it uses fuse wire.
<li><b>Dampers</b> - Dampers protect the surrounding buildings but cost money
<li><b>Readying takes</b> - The amount of time how long the readying takes. The more there are explosive charges the longer the readying takes.
<li><b>Total cost</b> - Total cost of current detonation plan if executed
<li><b>Money</b> - Amount of money in use
<li><b>Detonate</b> - Detonate all explosive charges
</ul>
<p>
The next button has two modes:
<ul>
<li><b>Expl. mode</b> - When Expl. mode reads on this button left mouse button sets explosive charge on the map
<li><b>Damper mode</b> - When Damper mode is set the left mouse button sets dampers on the map and estimation of explosive ranges is shown.
</ul>
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Zoom out/in</b> - Change zoom level.
<li><b>Cancel job</b> - If you want to get out of this job, click this and confirm cancel.
<li><b>Finish map</b> - When the target building is damaged, this button is enabled. You may detonate another explosives if you're not satisfied with the results.

<li><b>Map nr/text</b> - Enter map number or text string for random map.
<li><b>Save &amp; Load</b> - Save and load game menu
<li><b>Exit to main menu</b> - Go to main menu where you may return to game, change settings or quit game.
</ul>

<h4><a name="financial">FINANCIAL DECISIONS</H4>
From this menu you control the amount of your workers and see the statistics.

<ul>
<li>Workers affect on preparation and site clearing time. Amount of workers can't be lower than maximum amount of bulldozers or lorries.
<li>Bulldozers and lorries affect on site clearing time.
<li>Guards affect on security and handle possible problem situations.
</ul>

<p>
<b>Advanced management</b>
<p>
From this menu you may change settings that affect on monthly costs and taxes. Taxes are paid from payments you earn and they are not month-based. Other payments are month-based.
<ul>
<li><b>Taxes</b> - if you don't pay enough tax, you might get caught and pay extra later.
<li><b>Accountant</b> - affects on reliability of the bookkeeping. If you have a bad accountant it can lead to inspection where you must hire a good accountant to clear the mess in bookkeeping department.
<li><b>Insurances</b> - when (not if) you break something, the insurance compensates on the damages
<li><b>Competitors</b> - if you want to play foul, this is the choice for you. Sometimes competitors lose money, sometimes you get caught and have to pay for criminal acts. The more sabotage costs, the more damage it will do, but the risk of getting caught is also greater. When you have sabotaged competitor, there is certain time until you can do sabotage again.
</ul>
<p>

<h2><a name="readying">READYING</H2>

<a name="explosives">
<h4>SETTING UP EXPLOSIVES</H4>
<ul>
<li>Select suitable explosive type
<li>Use slide to increase amount of explosives in charge
<li>If you want some delay to explosive charge, use Delay slide
<li>Click on the desired place on the map, and the charge is shown as square. 
<li>If you want to direct explosive during setting, you may do it during insertion by clicking and then drawing mouse to desired direction, and after that releasing the button.
<li>You can select a charge by pressing <b>Add</b> button (so it changes to <b>Select</b>) on the side panel and then left-clicking on desired charge. The selected charge turns into white square. If you want to replace this charge, just click on the map. If you want to place a new charge, click <b>Add</b> button.
<li>If you want to remove entirely the selected charge, click on <b>Remove</b> button. The next charge is selected automatically. If you then want to add charges, just click on <b>Add</b> button.
</ul>

<h4><a name="dampers">SETTING UP DAMPERS</H4>
<ul>
<li>Before detonation it is recommendable to put some dampers to protect neighbouring buildings and structures. This is done by clicking on <b>Expl. mode</b> button that is then changed into <b>Damper mode</b> button. Then click and drag mouse on the map, and square shows where dampers are placed. The lower part of the rectangle must be on ground, otherwise dampers are not placed. <li>Dampers may be removed in Damper mode by left-clicking on damper set on map. This removes all dampers that are connected to the clicked damper.
</ul>

<h4><a name="tips">GENERAL TIPS</h4>
<ul>
<li>Try to destroy as much of the building as possible, with so few detonations as possible (because more debris costs more, and each detonation costs)
<li>Distance decreases explosion force
<li>Hard structures decrease force more than for example air. Block's endurance is shown below block's name. Higher value means tougher block.
<li>Building may collapse if enough blocks are destroyed. This applies to all buildings, including the neighbours.
<li>Use dampers if you're not very sure about the explosion forces. It is cheaper to pay for some dampers than for the neighbouring building's damages.
<li>When in Damper mode the <b>estimation</b> of explosive ranges is shown as circle around the explosive charge. The real range of the explosive force may differ greatly from this estimation.
<li>The more damaged materials left on the detonation scene, the longer the cleaning lasts, and therefore costs more. Amount of bulldozers, lorries and crew decreases cleaning time, but naturally more crew costs more. Balancing workers and other equipment is profitable, too big disparity will slow down. One bulldozer and/or lorry per 10 men is maximum profitable amount.
<li>Traffic signs, water posts and other objects are also counted as non-target area and therefore if you break them, you'll pay for them.
<li>In the top right corner there is a value that shows how precious the block is where the mouse is on. Green means it is detonation area, red means it is not. 
</ul>
